- When you trade in the forex market, you buy or sell in currency pairs.
- three categories of currency pairs, “majors“, “crosses“ and “exotics“
- major currency pairs always include USD
- Cross-currency pairs do NOT include the U.S. dollar
- Exotic currency pairs consist of one major currency and one currency from an emerging market (EM).
- Major currencies are most liquid (most active)

### Exotic pairs
- exotic pairs aren’t as heavily traded as the “majors” or “crosses,” so the transaction costs associated with trading these pairs are usually bigger.
- due to the overall lower degree of liquidity, exotic currency pairs tend to be far more sensitive to economic and geopolitical events.
- for example, a political scandal or unexpected election results can cause an exotic pair’s exchange rate to swing violently.
